                            an amazing experience for me, and has given me profound knowledge about the
                            world's most important issues, while introducing me to new friends; this year,
                            I hope to share some of these experiences with all of you. I am fully committed
                            to supporting all of you through the TBSRJMUN journey, so feel free to contact me
                            if you have any questions or concerns! Looking forward to meeting you all in person

                            Hello delegates! My name is Felipe Trojman and I am a senior at the British School of Rio
                            de Janeiro. I am looking forward to serve as your Under Secretary General for Junior Committees
                            in the 21st edition of TBSRJMUN. My passion for MUN began in 2017, and since then it only increased.
                            Despite this being my 16th and very last conference as a TBS student, I am thrilled to be having
                            the opportunity to work with such a diligent Secretariat team. As Under Secretary General,
                            I will do my best to make this conference extremely interesting and enjoyable to all delegates!
                            I am looking forward to meeting you all! If you have any doubts, please do not hesitate to contact me.

                            Dear delegates, fellow Leadership Team members, and Advisors, my name is Mariano Pucciarelli
                            and I am beyond honoured to be TBSRJMUN XXI’s Chief Operations Officer and Press Corps Director.
                            Since my early years at The British School of Rio de Janeiro, I became extremely involved with
                            Model United Nations and fell deeper in love with it with each passing conference. Nowadays,
                            as a Junior at TBSRJ, I look back and feel grateful for the marvellous collection of memories
                            and friends MUN has given me throughout the years. Our attendees’ experience and well-being
                            is our number one priority. Thus, TBSRJMUN’s main goal is to create a proper and safe environment
                            where all delegates can flourish their skills and have an amazing time while doing so. We are
                            working to make sure you all leave our conference with the fondest of memories. Thus, do not
                            worry if this is your first or twentieth conference, our entire team is always here to help
                            in any way needed. We will have a myriad of surprises and innovations to facilitate your stay
                            at Rio de Janeiro and our school, we cannot wait to show you all! Hence, I invite you all to
                            use this conference to make new friends, learn more about the world, and, most importantly,
                            grow not only as MUNers but as individuals. For those of you coming outside of Rio de Janeiro,
                            I wish you an amazing stay in the Cidade Maravilhosa. If you have any queries regarding our
                            conference’s logistics or press team, do not hesitate to contact me, I will be more than eager
                            to guide you through our processes. See you all in September!

                            Esteemed delegates and fellow faculty advisors, my name is Rafaela Pires,
                            I am a junior at TBSRJ and I am beyond honoured to be serving as your Secretary-General
                            for the twenty-first edition of TBSRJMUN! I quite cannot believe almost six years have passed
                            since the first conference I ever attended; if I could travel back then to give myself one piece
                            of advice, it would be: 'not everything has to be perfectly scrutinised, or perfectly written -
                            what makes you a diplomat of character is to speak from the heart.' As an ambitious delegate,
                            this is probably a sentence you would really like to relate to, which is why I invite you to
                            TBSRJMUN! I am thrilled to be having the opportunity to guide our leadership team along the
                            preparation of a very successful conference. Lastly, please don't be shy to ask questions or
                            express any doubts - I will always be available to support you! See you soon, and let's make
                            this edition of TBSRJMUN truly memorable!

                            my life in indescribable ways. Model United Nations has granted me a variety of valuable
                            experiences and lessons, and I hope that as Deputy Press Director, I can aid in documenting
                            the importance of politics, debate, and diplomacy for youth all across Brazil. I look forward
